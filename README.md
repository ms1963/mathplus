# matrix_vector_for_python
Just a trivial implementation of matrices in vectors done just for fun.

The demo code in demo_matrix.py shows how to use the trivial library. Given the fact that libraries like pandas, numpy exist, it is obviously useless to come up with a matrix and vector implementation. Nonetheless, I did it for the fun of experimentation.
